# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustring on a shop data
> Data provided for a shop, including customer gender, age, annual income, and spending score for the shop. Agglomerative HC is used to discover clusters


### To run the code:
```sh
python hc.py
```

## General comments:
* The segmentation will be based on the annual income & spending score.
* HC was used since the dataset is not large, HC is not optimum in the case of larger set of data, k-mean clustring performs would be a better choice then.
* A dendogram is drawn to show the distances between the clusters, and as well for rationalising the number of clusters
